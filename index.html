            <p> My name is Caleb Faris and I am from Flemingsburg, KY. I am now in my junior year at the University of Kentucky, and I am majoring in Information Communication Technology. Currently, I work at The Home Depot every weekday from 6 to 11 PM. In my spare time I like to read, listen to podcasts, play video games, watch sports, and spend time with my girlfriend and her two weiner dogs.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
    
            <p> I graduated from Fleming County High School in 2019. I then attended the University of Kentucky, which has not changed. However, when I began taking classes, my declared major was Electrical Engineering, and after 3 semesters of that I took one semester of classes in the Gatton College of Business. Then, after a recommendation from my advisor, I decided to begin taking classes for ICT, which I enjoyed enough to officially change my major to. </p>
    
        <h2> Jobs</h2>
    
            <p> While in high school, I worked with a local carpenter and a local insulation contractor. After my senior year of high school, I began interning at Fleming-Mason Energy, where I worked closely with the engineering department. After switching my major, I began working at Home Depot, where I will have been working for one year at the beginning of March.</p>
